**Microfrontend** is an architectural approach where a frontend app is split into **independently developed, deployed, and owned UI modules**, similar to microservices on the backend.

**Key points (concise):**

* Each microfrontend is a **self-contained app** (own tech stack, repo, CI/CD).
* Teams work **independently** and deploy without impacting others.
* Composed together at runtime or build time to form one UI.

**Common approaches:**

* **Module Federation (Webpack 5)** – most popular.
* **Single-SPA** – framework-agnostic orchestration.
* **iFrames** – strong isolation, heavier.
* **Web Components** – standards-based.

**Pros:** scalability, independent releases, team autonomy.
**Cons:** performance overhead, shared state complexity, duplication.
