**Microfrontend** is an architectural approach where a frontend app is split into **independently developed, deployed, and owned UI modules**, similar to microservices on the backend.

**Key points (concise):**

* Each microfrontend is a **self-contained app** (own tech stack, repo, CI/CD).
* Teams work **independently** and deploy without impacting others.
* Composed together at runtime or build time to form one UI.

**Common approaches:**

* **Module Federation (Webpack 5)** – most popular.
* **Single-SPA** – framework-agnostic orchestration.
* **iFrames** – strong isolation, heavier.
* **Web Components** – standards-based.

**Pros:** scalability, independent releases, team autonomy.
**Cons:** performance overhead, shared state complexity, duplication.



**Monofrontend** is the traditional frontend architecture where the **entire UI is built, deployed, and scaled as a single application**.

**Key points (concise):**

* Single codebase, single build, single deployment.
* Shared state, routing, and components in one app.
* One tech stack (e.g., React + Redux).

**Pros:** simple setup, easier debugging, better performance, simpler state management.
**Cons:** slower builds, tightly coupled teams, risky deployments as app grows.

**Monofrontend vs Microfrontend (quick view):**

* **Codebase:** one repo vs many
* **Deployment:** one pipeline vs independent
* **Team scaling:** harder vs easier
* **Complexity:** low vs high

**When to choose monofrontend:** small–medium apps, single team, fast iteration.
If you want, I can show **when to migrate from monofrontend → microfrontend** with clear signals.
