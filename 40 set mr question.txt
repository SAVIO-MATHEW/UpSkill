# 🔹 Ownership & Decision-Making

**1. How do you handle ambiguous requirements?**
I clarify with the Product Owner, confirm acceptance criteria, identify edge cases, and document assumptions before starting development.

**2. Feature designed end-to-end?**
I’ve handled dashboard modules from requirement analysis → component design → API integration → testing → deployment, ensuring performance and scalability.

**3. Refactor vs move forward?**
If refactor improves maintainability without delaying sprint goals significantly, I propose it. Otherwise, I create a technical debt task.

**4. Wrong estimation?**
I communicate early, explain the reason, and re-align sprint expectations transparently.

**5. Speed vs quality?**
I prioritize clean, maintainable code but adjust based on business urgency. Critical releases may prioritize delivery, followed by refactoring.

---

# 🔹 Technical Leadership

**6. How do you review code?**
I check readability, reusability, performance, edge cases, and adherence to standards.

**7. What do you look for in PR?**
Logic correctness, unnecessary re-renders, proper state handling, naming conventions, test coverage.

**8. Enforce coding standards?**
ESLint, Prettier, code reviews, and documented best practices.

**9. Repeated junior mistakes?**
Provide constructive feedback, explain reasoning, and mentor with examples.

**10. Rejected a design decision?**
Yes, when it impacted scalability. I proposed an alternative backed by technical reasoning.

---

# 🔹 Architecture & Scaling

**11. Structure large React app?**
Feature-based folder structure, shared components, centralized state management, service layer for APIs.

**12. Manage shared state?**
Redux Toolkit for global state; local state where possible to reduce complexity.

**13. Context vs Redux?**
Context for lightweight/global config; Redux for complex state with frequent updates.

**14. Avoid re-renders?**
React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, proper key usage.

**15. Performance bottlenecks?**
Profile with DevTools, optimize renders, lazy load, virtualize large lists.

---

# 🔹 Production & Stability

**16. Production outage?**
Stayed calm, analyzed logs, deployed hotfix, documented root cause.

**17. Cannot reproduce locally?**
Check logs, add temporary logging, test staging environment, compare environments.

**18. Ensure backward compatibility?**
Avoid breaking API contracts, support legacy props, gradual deprecation.

**19. API failures?**
Graceful error UI, retries, fallback messages.

**20. Monitor frontend errors?**
Use logging tools (e.g., Sentry-like systems) and browser console tracking.

---

# 🔹 Agile & Sprint

**21. Scope increase mid-sprint?**
Re-discuss with PO, adjust sprint backlog, avoid overcommitment.

**22. Unrealistic deadlines?**
Provide impact analysis and suggest phased delivery.

**23. Underperforming member?**
Support, mentor, understand challenges, escalate only if necessary.

**24. Story estimation?**
Break into subtasks, evaluate complexity, dependencies, and unknowns.

**25. Improve velocity?**
Better estimation, reduce technical debt, clear requirements.

---

# 🔹 Client Interaction

**26. Client demos?**
Yes, I explain functionality clearly and answer technical queries.

**27. Requirement change?**
Assess impact, communicate timeline changes.

**28. Explain technical constraints?**
Use simple language and business impact explanation.

**29. Manage expectations?**
Transparent communication and realistic timelines.

---

# 🔹 Personal & Growth

**30. Technical mistake?**
Underestimated integration complexity; learned better risk analysis.

**31. Manager feedback?**
Reliable, ownership-driven, calm under pressure.

**32. Preferred team environment?**
Collaborative, feedback-driven, Agile-based.

**33. Why senior engineer?**
Ownership, mentoring, architectural thinking, client handling.

**34. Growth plan?**
Move toward frontend architecture and technical leadership.

---

# 🔹 Tricky Questions

**35. No promotion in 2 years?**
I focus on learning and contribution; growth follows performance.

**36. Salary low?**
Previous role had different compensation structure; now aligning with market.

**37. Why not switch earlier?**
Focused on gaining strong project ownership experience.

**38. Better offer tomorrow?**
I evaluate long-term growth, not just salary.

**39. Relocation?**
