## **1–10: JavaScript Basics**

1. **What is JavaScript?**
   JavaScript is a single-threaded, interpreted programming language mainly used for web development.
   It enables dynamic content, event handling, and asynchronous operations in browsers.

2. **Difference between let, const, and var**
   `var` is function-scoped and allows re-declaration.
   `let` and `const` are block-scoped; `const` prevents reassignment but allows mutation.

3. **How does hoisting work?**
   JavaScript moves declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.
   `var` is initialized as `undefined`, while `let` and `const` stay in the Temporal Dead Zone.

4. **What is a closure?**
   A closure is created when a function remembers variables from its outer scope.
   This allows data persistence even after the outer function has finished execution.

5. **Explain the event loop**
   The event loop manages asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
   It processes the call stack first, then microtasks (Promises), then macrotasks.

6. **Difference between == and ===**
   `==` compares values after type coercion.
   `===` compares both value and type, making it safer and preferred.

7. **How do you check the type of a variable?**
   `typeof` is used for primitives, while `Array.isArray()` checks arrays.
   `instanceof` verifies object instances.

8. **What is the this keyword?**
   `this` refers to the execution context of a function.
   Its value depends on how the function is called, not where it is defined.

9. **Function declaration vs function expression**
   Function declarations are hoisted and available before definition.
   Function expressions are created at runtime and are not hoisted.

10. **How does setTimeout work?**
    `setTimeout` registers a callback with browser Web APIs.
    The callback executes after delay once the call stack is empty.

## **11–20: Functions & Scope**

11. **What is a callback function?**
    A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
    It is executed after a task completes, often used in async operations.

12. **What is a pure function?**
    A pure function returns the same output for the same input.
    It does not modify external state or produce side effects.

13. **call, apply, and bind differences**
    All three methods explicitly set the `this` value.
    `call` accepts arguments individually, `apply` as array, `bind` returns new function.

14. **Purpose of arguments object**
    It holds all arguments passed to a function dynamically.
    It is array-like and not available in arrow functions.

15. **How do you create a closure?**
    Define a function inside another function.
    The inner function accesses variables from the outer scope.

16. **What is the use of bind()?**
    `bind()` permanently sets the `this` value for a function.
    Commonly used in event handlers and React class components.

17. **Difference between shallow and deep copy**
    Shallow copy duplicates top-level properties only.
    Deep copy creates new references for all nested objects.

18. **How does the call stack work?**
    The call stack tracks function execution order.
    It follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

19. **What is function currying?**
    Currying breaks a function with multiple arguments into smaller functions.
    Each function takes one argument and returns another function.

20. **How can you avoid callback hell?**
    Use Promises or async/await for better readability.
    Breaking logic into smaller functions also helps.

## **21–30: Objects & Prototypes**

21. **What is prototypal inheritance?**
    JavaScript objects inherit properties from other objects.
    This inheritance happens through the prototype chain.

22. **How do you create an object?**
    Using object literals, constructor functions, or `Object.create()`.
    Each method defines prototype behavior differently.

23. **Purpose of prototype property**
    It allows methods and properties to be shared across instances.
    This improves memory efficiency.

24. **Object.create vs constructor pattern**
    `Object.create()` directly assigns a prototype.
    Constructors create instances using the `new` keyword.

25. **How do you add a property to an object?**
    Use dot notation or bracket notation.
    Bracket notation supports dynamic keys.

26. **What is hasOwnProperty used for?**
    Checks whether a property belongs directly to an object.
    It excludes inherited properties.

27. **How can you prevent object modification?**
    `Object.freeze()` prevents all changes.
    `Object.seal()` allows value modification but not structure changes.

28. **Describe the use of the new keyword**
    It creates a new object instance.
    Binds `this` and links the prototype automatically.

29. **What is object destructuring?**
    Destructuring extracts properties into variables.
    It improves readability and reduces repetitive code.

30. **Difference between null and undefined**
    `undefined` means a variable is declared but not assigned.
    `null` is an intentional empty value.

## **31–40: DOM & Events**

31. **What is the DOM?**
    The DOM represents HTML as a tree structure.
    JavaScript uses it to manipulate page content.

32. **How do you select elements in JavaScript?**
    Use `getElementById`, `querySelector`, or `querySelectorAll`.
    Modern apps prefer query selectors.

33. **Explain event delegation**
    Events are handled at a parent level instead of children.
    This improves performance and handles dynamic elements.

34. **Purpose of addEventListener**
    It attaches event handlers to elements.
    Allows multiple handlers without overwriting.

35. **How do you create and remove elements?**
    Use `createElement` and `append`.
    Remove elements using `remove()` or `removeChild()`.

36. **Explain event propagation**
    Events travel through capturing, target, and bubbling phases.
    Understanding this helps control event flow.

37. **How can you prevent default behavior?**
    Call `event.preventDefault()`.
    Commonly used in forms and anchor tags.

38. **What are data- attributes?**
    They store custom data in HTML elements.
    Accessible via the `dataset` property.

39. **innerHTML vs textContent**
    `innerHTML` parses and renders HTML.
    `textContent` safely inserts plain text.

40. **How do you handle asynchronous code?**
    Using callbacks, Promises, or async/await.
    Async/await offers cleaner and readable code.
