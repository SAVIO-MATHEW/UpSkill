**Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** is the period between when a variable is **declared** and when it is **initialized**, during which you **cannot access it** — otherwise JavaScript throws a **ReferenceError**.

It applies to **let** and **const**, not **var**.

### Quick example

```js
console.log(a);  // ❌ ReferenceError (TDZ)
let a = 10;

console.log(b);  // ❌ ReferenceError (TDZ)
const b = 20;
```

### Why it happens

Even though `let` and `const` are *hoisted*, they are not initialized until execution reaches their line.
Accessing them earlier = TDZ error.

### Simple explanation

* **var → hoisted + initialized = usable early (but undefined)**
* **let/const → hoisted but NOT initialized = TDZ error**

If you want, I can show TDZ behaviour with functions, classes, or use-cases in React.
