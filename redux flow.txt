Redux follows a clear and structured flow to manage state in a predictable way for JavaScript applications. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

### **1. Action**
- **What**: Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe what you want to do or change in the state.
- **How**: They must have a `type` property (a string) that describes the action, and can optionally include a `payload` with additional data.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const incrementAction = { type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 };
  ```

---

### **2. Reducer**
- **What**: Reducers are functions that specify how the state should change based on the action.
- **How**: It takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'INCREMENT':
        return state + action.payload;
      case 'DECREMENT':
        return state - action.payload;
      default:
        return state;
    }
  };
  ```

---

### **3. Store**
- **What**: The store is a centralized place to keep your state.
- **How**: It’s created using the `createStore()` method and holds the entire state tree of your application.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { createStore } from 'redux';
  const store = createStore(counterReducer);
  ```

---

### **4. Dispatch**
- **What**: Dispatch is the method used to send actions to the store.
- **How**: When an action is dispatched, Redux forwards it to the reducer, which updates the state accordingly.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 });
  ```

---

### **5. Subscription**
- **What**: Subscriptions allow components to listen for changes in the store.
- **How**: You use `store.subscribe()` to execute a function whenever the state changes.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  store.subscribe(() => {
    console.log('State updated:', store.getState());
  });
  ```

---

### **Flow Summary**
1. **Action**: Describes the change you want to make.
2. **Reducer**: Receives the action and updates the state.
3. **Store**: Holds the state.
4. **Dispatch**: Sends the action to the reducer.
5. **Subscription**: Reacts to state changes.
