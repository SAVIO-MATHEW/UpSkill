Object destructuring in JavaScript is a convenient way to extract values from objects and assign them to variables in a single step. It's part of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and is widely used for cleaner, more readable code.

### Syntax and Example
Here's how object destructuring works:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  city: "New York"
};

const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name); // Output: Alice
console.log(age);  // Output: 25
```

In this example, the properties `name` and `age` from the `person` object are directly assigned to variables with the same names.

### Key Features of Object Destructuring

1. **Default Values**: Provide default values if a property doesn't exist in the object.
   ```javascript
   const { name, country = "USA" } = person;
   console.log(country); // Output: USA
   ```

2. **Renaming Variables**: Use a different variable name than the property.
   ```javascript
   const { name: fullName } = person;
   console.log(fullName); // Output: Alice
   ```

3. **Nested Objects**: Extract properties from nested objects.
   ```javascript
   const student = {
     info: {
       firstName: "Bob",
       lastName: "Smith"
     }
   };

   const { info: { firstName, lastName } } = student;
   console.log(firstName); // Output: Bob
   console.log(lastName);  // Output: Smith
   ```

4. **Rest Properties**: Gather remaining properties into a new object.
   ```javascript
   const { name, ...rest } = person;
   console.log(rest); // Output: { age: 25, city: "New York" }
   ```
