Nice one — this is a **classic senior-level JS question**. Here’s a crisp, step-by-step answer you can say in interviews.

## Question

**What happens step-by-step when JavaScript executes a function inside another function?**

---

## Step-by-step execution

### 1️⃣ Global Execution Context (GEC) is created

When the script starts:

* Global Execution Context is pushed to the call stack
* `this` → `window` (browser)
* Memory phase:

  * Functions stored fully
  * Variables hoisted (`undefined`)

---

### 2️⃣ Outer function is called

```js
function outer() {
  let a = 10;
  inner();
}
outer();
```

* A **new Execution Context** for `outer` is created
* It has:

  * Its own **Lexical Environment**
  * Access to **Global scope** via scope chain
* `a = 10` is stored

---

### 3️⃣ Inner function is called

```js
function inner() {
  console.log(a);
}
```

* A **new Execution Context** for `inner` is created
* It contains:

  * Local variables (if any)
  * Reference to **outer’s lexical environment**

👉 This reference chain is the **Scope Chain**

---

### 4️⃣ Variable lookup via Scope Chain

When `inner()` executes:

* JS looks for `a` in `inner` scope ❌
* Moves up to `outer` scope ✅
* Finds `a = 10`
* Stops searching

---

### 5️⃣ Execution contexts are destroyed

* `inner()` finishes → its context is popped
* `outer()` finishes → its context is popped
* Global context remains until program ends

---

## Visual stack

```
Call Stack
---------
inner()
outer()
Global
```

---

## Key concepts involved

* Execution Context
* Lexical Environment
* Scope Chain
* Call Stack
* Variable resolution

---

## One-liner interview answer 🧠

> When a function is called, JavaScript creates a new execution context with its own lexical environment. If a variable isn’t found locally, JS resolves it via the scope chain by moving up to parent environments until found or reaching global scope.
