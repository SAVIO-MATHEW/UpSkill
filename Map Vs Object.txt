Yes — **a Map is an object**, but **not the same kind of object as `{}`**.

In JS, almost everything is an object, and Map is a special built-in object designed for key-value storage.

## Map vs Normal Object `{}`

| Feature          | `Map`                                   | `{}` Object                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Type             | Special object                          | Plain object                            |
| Keys allowed     | **Any type** (object, function, number) | **Strings & Symbols only**              |
| Order            | Preserves insertion order               | Mostly insertion order (but with rules) |
| Size             | `map.size`                              | `Object.keys(obj).length`               |
| Built-in methods | `set, get, has, delete`                 | None (you manage manually)              |

### Example difference

```js
const obj = {};
obj[{}] = "value";
console.log(obj); // key becomes "[object Object]"
```

```js
const map = new Map();
map.set({}, "value");
console.log(map); // real object key stored
```

### Key idea

* `{}` is for **simple structured data**
* `Map` is for **dynamic key-value storage**

---

### One-line answer

> Map is a special type of object made specifically for key-value storage, more powerful than plain objects.
