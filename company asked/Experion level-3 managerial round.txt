🔹 1. Tell me about a project where you took ownership.

Answer:
In my current project, I owned the frontend architecture for a client-facing dashboard built with React and Redux Toolkit. I was responsible for requirement analysis, component design, API integration, code reviews, and production deployment.
When performance issues occurred due to large datasets, I implemented memoization, lazy loading, and virtualization, reducing load time by 40%. I ensured timely delivery and zero critical production bugs post-release.

🔹 2. Have you mentored juniors?

Answer:
Yes. I mentored 2 junior developers by conducting code reviews, explaining React best practices, and guiding them on reusable component design. I also helped them understand performance optimization and debugging strategies. This improved our sprint velocity and reduced rework.

🔹 3. How do you handle changing client requirements?

Answer:
First, I analyze impact on scope, timeline, and dependencies. Then I discuss with the product owner and communicate clearly about effort changes. I ensure proper documentation and adjust sprint planning accordingly. I focus on flexibility without compromising code quality.

🔹 4. How do you ensure code quality?

Answer:

Follow clean architecture and reusable components

Use ESLint & Prettier standards

Conduct peer code reviews

Write unit tests (Jest/RTL)

Test edge cases before raising PR

Quality is ensured before it reaches production.

🔹 5. How do you handle production issues?

Answer:
I stay calm, reproduce the issue locally or in staging, identify root cause using logs/debugging tools, and provide a hotfix if critical. After resolution, I document the issue and add preventive checks to avoid recurrence.

🔹 6. Why are you leaving your current company?

Answer (Safe & Professional):
I’m looking for better growth opportunities, exposure to challenging projects, and a chance to work in a structured environment where I can take on more responsibility and contribute strategically.

🔹 7. Why Experion Technologies?

Answer:
Experion is known for product engineering excellence and working with global clients. I’m particularly interested in contributing to scalable digital solutions and being part of a team that values ownership and innovation.

🔹 8. Where do you see yourself in 3–5 years?

Answer:
I see myself growing into a Senior/Lead Frontend Engineer role, driving architectural decisions, mentoring teams, and contributing to technical strategy while still being hands-on with development.

🔹 9. How do you prioritize tasks when everything is urgent?

Answer:
I evaluate:

Business impact

Production severity

Dependencies

Deadline risk

Then I align with the product owner and team to prioritize based on value and risk.

🔹 10. What differentiates you from other React developers?

Answer:

Strong fundamentals (JS + React internals)

Focus on performance optimization

Ownership mindset

Good client communication

Ability to balance clean code with delivery timelines

🔹 11. Tell me about a failure.

Answer:
Early in my career, I underestimated a complex API integration which delayed delivery. I learned to break tasks properly, estimate buffer time, and communicate risks early. Since then, my estimations have become much more accurate.

🔹 12. What motivates you?

Answer:
Building scalable solutions that users interact with daily motivates me. I enjoy solving performance bottlenecks and seeing measurable improvements in application efficiency.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔹 1. Why should we hire you over other candidates?

My transitions were based on growth opportunities and role expansion, not short-term decisions. I’m currently looking for stability, long-term contribution, and ownership in a technically strong environment.

👉 Focus on growth, not salary.

🔹 4. What if your manager gives you a task you disagree with?

Smart Answer:
I would respectfully share my perspective with technical reasoning. If the final decision differs, I’ll align with it and execute professionally. Team alignment is more important than individual preference.

🔹 5. What is your biggest weakness?

Smart Answer (Safe & Growth-Oriented):
Earlier, I used to spend extra time perfecting UI details. Over time, I’ve learned to balance perfection with delivery timelines and prioritize based on business value.

Compensation is important, but role clarity, learning opportunities, and growth matter more to me. I’m open to discussion if the role aligns well with my expectations.

👉 Keeps negotiation flexible.

🔹 8. If selected, how soon can you join?

Smart Answer (Based on your case):
I am currently serving my notice period, and my last working day is 14 April 2026. I can coordinate for knowledge transfer and try to join at the earliest possible date.

🔹 9. What motivates you besides salary?

Smart Answer:
Challenging projects, performance optimization problems, learning new architectural patterns, and being part of a team where I can contribute meaningfully.

🔹 10. If your performance drops, what will you do?

Smart Answer:
I’ll first analyze the root cause — workload, clarity, or skill gap. Then I’ll proactively seek feedback and improve. I believe in taking responsibility rather than waiting for escalation.

🔹 11. Where do you see yourself long term — management or technical?

Smart Answer:
In the near term, I want to deepen my technical expertise and grow into a senior/lead frontend role. Eventually, I’d like to balance technical leadership with mentoring responsibilities.

🔥 BONUS – Very Tricky One:
🔹 “Why should we trust you with client communication?”

Smart Answer:
I’ve worked in offshore models and handled client demos, requirement clarifications, and change discussions. I ensure clarity, document decisions, and communicate risks early — which builds trust.
