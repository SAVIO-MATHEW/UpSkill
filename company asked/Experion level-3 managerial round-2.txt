# 💰 SALARY NEGOTIATION – SMART ANSWERS

### 🔹 1️⃣ “What is your current CTC?”

**Safe Answer:**

### 🔹 2️⃣ “What are your salary expectations?”

**Best Strategy (Give Range):**

👉 Always give a **range**, not a single number.

Perfect 👍 Here are **managerial-round answers** tailored for a **5-year React developer** (clear, confident, ownership-focused).

---

# 🔹 1️⃣ Explain Your Project Architecture

**Answer:**
We followed a modular architecture using React functional components with Hooks. State management was handled using Redux Toolkit for global state and local state via useState/useReducer. API communication was handled through a centralized service layer. We followed separation of concerns — UI, business logic, and API layers were clearly structured. This improved maintainability and scalability.

---

# 🔹 2️⃣ How Does React Lifecycle Work?

**Answer:**
In functional components, lifecycle is handled using Hooks.

* `useEffect` handles side effects (like componentDidMount/update/unmount).
* Cleanup functions handle unmounting logic.
  React follows a render → commit → effect execution pattern.

---

# 🔹 3️⃣ How Do You Optimize Performance?

**Answer:**

* Memoization using `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`
* Code splitting with `React.lazy`
* Avoid unnecessary re-renders
* Virtualization for large lists
* Proper key usage
* API response caching

I also use Chrome DevTools Profiler to detect re-render issues.

---

# 🔹 4️⃣ How Do You Handle Production Bugs?

**Answer:**
First, I reproduce the issue in staging. Then I analyze logs and isolate root cause. For critical issues, I provide a hotfix. After resolution, I document the issue and add preventive checks or monitoring.

---

# 🔹 5️⃣ Explain Redux Flow

**Answer:**
Redux follows unidirectional data flow:
Component → Dispatch Action → Reducer → Store Update → UI Re-render

Redux Toolkit simplifies this by reducing boilerplate and handling immutability internally.

---

# 🔹 6️⃣ What If API Is Slow?

**Answer:**

* Implement loading indicators
* Add request timeout handling
* Use pagination or lazy loading
* Cache responses
* Discuss with backend for optimization

User experience should never freeze.

---

# 🔹 7️⃣ How Do You Handle Critical Production Issues?

**Answer:**
Stay calm, prioritize severity, communicate with stakeholders, provide temporary fix if needed, then deploy a stable patch. Transparency and speed matter.

---

# 🔹 8️⃣ How Do You Estimate Tasks?

**Answer:**
I break features into smaller subtasks, estimate based on complexity, dependencies, and unknown risks. I also add buffer for edge cases and testing.

---

# 🔹 9️⃣ How Do You Ensure Code Quality?

**Answer:**

* ESLint & Prettier
* Code reviews
* Unit testing (Jest/RTL)
* Avoid deep nesting
* Reusable components
* Clear naming conventions

---

# 🔹 🔟 Have You Mentored Juniors?

**Answer:**
Yes. I guide them on component structure, performance practices, and debugging. I conduct code reviews and encourage clean coding standards.

---

# 🔹 1️⃣1️⃣ How Do You Handle Client Communication?

**Answer:**
I ensure clarity, confirm requirements in writing, document change requests, and communicate risks early. Regular updates build trust.

---

# 🔹 1️⃣2️⃣ How Do You Resolve Conflicts?

**Answer:**
I focus on problem, not person. I encourage discussion backed by technical reasoning. Final alignment is based on project benefit.

---

# 🔥 Bonus – Tricky One

### ❓ What Will You Do If Deadline Is Unrealistic?

**Answer:**
I will communicate impact clearly, propose phased delivery, and prioritize critical features first instead of compromising quality.
