This confusion is **very common** — and you’re asking the *right* question.

### Short truth

> **`.jsx` and `.js` both end up returning JSX → compiled to JS → creates HTML in the browser.**
> The difference is **not technical**, it’s about **clarity, tooling, and team discipline**.

---

## What actually happens under the hood

JSX is **not HTML**.

```jsx
<h1>Hello</h1>
```

⬇️ compiled by Babel ⬇️

```js
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");
```

So whether the file is:

* `App.js`
* `App.jsx`

👉 **the browser only sees JavaScript**.

---

## Why `.js` still works with JSX

Modern setups (CRA, Vite, Next.js, Webpack) configure Babel to:

* parse JSX in **both `.js` and `.jsx`**

So this is valid:

```js
export default function App() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
```

---

## Why some devs prefer `.jsx`

### 1️⃣ Clear intent (big reason)

```txt
Button.jsx  → React component
utils.js    → plain JS logic
```

You instantly know:

* this file **renders UI**
* not a helper or service

This matters in **large codebases**.

---

### 2️⃣ Tooling & editor support

Some editors:

* give better JSX highlighting
* auto-import React types
* smarter linting

Especially useful with **TypeScript + JSX (`.tsx`)**.

---

### 3️⃣ Enforced architecture

Teams use rules like:

* `.jsx` → components only
* `.js` → hooks, utils, services

This improves **maintainability**.

---

## Why many devs still use `.js`

### 1️⃣ Less noise

React devs are used to JSX everywhere.

```txt
App.js
Modal.js
Header.js
```

Simple. Clean.

---

### 2️⃣ Framework conventions

* **Next.js** → `.js` by default
* **CRA** → `.js` everywhere
* ESLint configs assume JSX in `.js`

---

## What senior teams usually do

### Option A (most common)

```txt
components/
  Modal.js
  Header.js
hooks/
  useFetch.js
utils/
  formatDate.js
```

JSX inside `.js`, no problem.

---

### Option B (very structured teams)

```txt
components/
  Modal.jsx
  Header.jsx
hooks/
  useFetch.js
services/
  api.js
```

Clear separation.

---

## The only rule that matters

> **Be consistent across the codebase.**

Mixing randomly:

```txt
Modal.js
Header.jsx
Footer.js
```

❌ smells bad.

---

### Interview-ready answer 🧠

> JSX is just syntax sugar compiled to JavaScript. Both `.js` and `.jsx` work because tooling supports JSX in `.js`. Teams choose `.jsx` mainly for clarity and architecture, not because it changes behavior.
