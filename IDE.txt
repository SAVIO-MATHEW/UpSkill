Nice, jumping to tools now 👌

## 💻 What is an IDE?

**IDE = Integrated Development Environment**

> A software application that helps you **write, run, debug, and manage code** in one place.

## 🧠 Think of it as

A **smart code editor + tools** bundled together.

## ⚡ IDE vs Code Editor

| Code Editor                 | IDE                           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Lightweight                 | Full toolkit                  |
| Example: Notepad++, Sublime | VS Code, IntelliJ             |
| Basic editing               | Debugging, compiling, testing |

👉 VS Code is technically a **code editor**, but with extensions it behaves like an IDE.

## 🧠 One-line understanding

> IDE = **All-in-one environment to develop software efficiently**

If you want, I can explain **compiler vs interpreter vs IDE** — another common confusion.
