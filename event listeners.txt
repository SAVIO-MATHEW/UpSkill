JavaScript event handling is a way to manage interactions between users and web pages. Events are actions or occurrences, such as clicks, key presses, form submissions, or page loading, that JavaScript can detect and respond to.

### Basics of Event Handling
1. **Event Types**: Common event types include:
   - `click`: Triggered when an element is clicked.
   - `keydown` / `keyup`: Triggered when a key is pressed or released.
   - `submit`: Triggered when a form is submitted.
   - `load`: Triggered when the page or an image has fully loaded.
   - `mouseover`: Triggered when the mouse hovers over an element.

2. **Event Listeners**: You can use `addEventListener` to attach an event handler to an element.
   ```javascript
   const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

   // Attach a click event listener
   button.addEventListener("click", () => {
     alert("Button clicked!");
   });
   ```

3. **Inline Event Handling**: You can also directly specify an event in the HTML, but it's considered less modular and harder to maintain.
   ```html
   <button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
   ```

4. **Removing Event Listeners**:
   ```javascript
   const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

   const clickHandler = () => {
     alert("Button clicked!");
   };

   button.addEventListener("click", clickHandler);

   // Remove the event listener
   button.removeEventListener("click", clickHandler);
   ```

### Event Object
When an event occurs, an `Event` object is passed to the event handler, providing details about the event.
```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  console.log(`Key pressed: ${event.key}`);
  console.log(`Key code: ${event.code}`);
});
```

### Event Propagation
Events propagate through the DOM in two phases:
1. **Capturing Phase**: The event travels from the root to the target element.
2. **Bubbling Phase**: The event travels back up from the target to the root.

You can control this behavior:
```javascript
document.getElementById("child").addEventListener(
  "click",
  (event) => {
    console.log("Child clicked!");
    event.stopPropagation(); // Stops the event from propagating further
  },
  true // Use capturing phase (default is false for bubbling)
);
```
