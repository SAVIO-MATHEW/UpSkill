In JavaScript, "closure" is a concept that allows a function to access variables from its enclosing scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. It's a powerful feature often used for encapsulation, data privacy, and maintaining state.

Here’s a simple example to demonstrate closures:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  let count = 0; // A local variable in outerFunction

  function innerFunction() {
    count++; // Inner function has access to outerFunction's variables
    console.log(`Count is now: ${count}`);
  }

  return innerFunction; // Returning the inner function
}

const closureExample = outerFunction(); // Create a closure
closureExample(); // Count is now: 1
closureExample(); // Count is now: 2
```

In this example:
- The `innerFunction` can access the variable `count` from `outerFunction`, even though `outerFunction` has already finished executing.
- The combination of the function and its surrounding state (variables it can access) is called a "closure."

Closures are widely used in JavaScript, including scenarios like callbacks, event handlers, and private variables.
