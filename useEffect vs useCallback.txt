Great question! Both `useEffect` and `useCallback` are React hooks, but they serve very different purposes. Here's how they differ:

### `useEffect`
- **Purpose**: It is used for side effects in functional components, like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
- **Usage**: It runs after the component renders, and you can control when it runs by passing dependencies in an array.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("This runs after the component renders.");
  }, [dependency]); // Runs whenever 'dependency' changes
  ```

### `useCallback`
- **Purpose**: It is used to memoize a callback function, preventing unnecessary re-creation of the function on every render.
- **Usage**: Useful when passing a function as a prop to child components to optimize rendering and performance.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("This is memoized.");
  }, [dependency]); // Updates only if 'dependency' changes
  ```

**Key Difference**:
- `useEffect` is for managing side effects based on render cycles.
- `useCallback` is for memoizing functions to optimize performance.

Feel free to ask if you'd like a deeper dive into either of them!
