“Testing in JavaScript ensures code correctness and prevents regressions. The three popular frameworks are Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine. Jest is zero-config and great for React, Mocha is flexible and often paired with Chai for backend testing, and Jasmine is a BDD framework with built-in assertions and spies. They all serve the same purpose: writing automated unit tests, but differ in setup and style.”

“Jest is the easiest to start with, especially for React, since it includes everything. Mocha is more flexible but requires extra libraries like Chai and Sinon. Jasmine is a BDD framework with built-in assertions and spies, making it simple but less popular today compared to Jest.”

In React, Jest is the most common testing framework because it integrates with React Testing Library and supports snapshot testing. 

sum.test.js
test('adds 2 + 3 to equal 5', () => {
  expect(2 + 3).toBe(5);
});


Write tests in *.test.js or *.spec.js.

// Button.js
export default function Button({ label }) {
  return <button>{label}</button>;
}

// Button.test.js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Button from './Button';

test('renders button with label', () => {
  render(<Button label="Click Me" />);
  expect(screen.getByText("Click Me")).toBeInTheDocument();
});

npm run test

| Concept       | Meaning             |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| `test()`      | Defines a test case |
| `expect()`    | Assertion           |
| `render()`    | Mount component     |
| `fireEvent()` | Simulate events     |
| `screen`      | Query DOM           |

Good 👍 you’re asking about the **different `toBe*` matchers in Jest**.

Here are the important ones you should know for interviews.

---

# 🔥 1️⃣ `toBe()`

Checks **strict equality (===)**.

```js
expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
```

Use for:

* Primitives (number, string, boolean)

---

# 🔥 2️⃣ `toEqual()`

Checks **deep equality** (objects & arrays).

```js
expect({ name: "Mathew" }).toEqual({ name: "Mathew" });
```

Use for:

* Objects
* Arrays

⚠️ `toBe()` would fail here because objects compare by reference.

---

# 🔥 3️⃣ `toStrictEqual()`

Stricter version of `toEqual()`.

It also checks:

* Undefined properties
* Object types

---

# 🔥 4️⃣ `toBeTruthy()`

Checks if value is truthy.

```js
expect("hello").toBeTruthy();
```

Truthy values:

* true
* non-empty string
* non-zero number
* objects

---

# 🔥 5️⃣ `toBeFalsy()`

Checks if value is falsy.

```js
expect(0).toBeFalsy();
```

Falsy values:

* false
* 0
* ""
* null
* undefined
* NaN

---

# 🔥 6️⃣ `toBeNull()`

```js
expect(null).toBeNull();
```

---

# 🔥 7️⃣ `toBeUndefined()`

```js
expect(undefined).toBeUndefined();
```

---

# 🔥 8️⃣ `toContain()`

Checks if array or string contains a value.

```js
expect([1, 2, 3]).toContain(2);
expect("hello").toContain("ell");
```

---

# 🔥 9️⃣ `toHaveLength()`

```js
expect([1, 2, 3]).toHaveLength(3);
```

---

# 🔥 🔟 `toBeGreaterThan()`

```js
expect(10).toBeGreaterThan(5);
```

Also:

* `toBeLessThan()`
* `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual()`
* `toBeLessThanOrEqual()`

---

# 🔥 1️⃣1️⃣ `toThrow()`

Used for testing errors.

```js
function errorFunc() {
  throw new Error("Error");
}

expect(() => errorFunc()).toThrow("Error");
```

---

# 🔥 1️⃣2️⃣ `toMatch()`

Used for regex/string matching.

```js
expect("React Fiber").toMatch(/Fiber/);
```

---

# 🔥 1️⃣3️⃣ `toHaveBeenCalled()`

Used with mocks.

```js
const fn = jest.fn();
fn();

expect(fn).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

Also:

* `toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)`
* `toHaveBeenCalledWith(args)`

---

# 🧠 Interview-Level Summary

> `toBe` checks strict equality, `toEqual` checks deep equality, `toContain` checks presence, and `toHaveBeenCalled` is used for mock function assertions. Different matchers are used depending on the type of value being tested.

If you want, I can next explain:

* Mocking API calls in Jest
* Testing async code in Jest
* Difference between `toBe` vs `toEqual` (deep internal explanation)
* Real-world React testing patterns

Tell me 👌
