Good question — this is one of those things that *feels* wrong until you understand React’s mental model.

## Short answer

> A function component can have **any number of `useEffect` hooks** because each `useEffect` is an **independent side-effect subscription**, not a lifecycle replacement.

---

## How this works

Think of a function component as:

* a **description of UI**
* plus a list of **effects to run after commit**

Each `useEffect` call:

* registers **one effect**
* with its own dependencies
* and its own cleanup

```jsx
function Component() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // effect A
    return () => cleanupA();
  }, [a]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // effect B
    return () => cleanupB();
  }, [b]);

  return <UI />;
}
```

React tracks them **by call order**, not by name.

---

## Why this is actually better

### 1️⃣ Separation of concerns

Instead of one huge effect:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
  addListener();
  startTimer();
  return () => {
    removeListener();
    clearTimer();
  };
}, []);
```

You split responsibilities:

```js
useEffect(fetchData, []);
useEffect(addListener, []);
useEffect(startTimer, []);
```

Each effect:

* has its own lifecycle
* cleans up itself
* reruns only when its dependencies change

---

### 2️⃣ Independent lifecycles

Each effect can:

* run on mount
* re-run on dependency change
* clean up independently

React doesn’t limit you to “componentDidMount once”.

---

## Internals (simple view)

React stores effects like a list:

```
Component Fiber
  ├─ Effect #1
  ├─ Effect #2
  ├─ Effect #3
```

On commit:

* React iterates the list
* executes each effect
* stores each cleanup separately

---

## Important rule (hooks rule)

Hooks must be:

* called **unconditionally**
* in the **same order every render**

That’s how React matches “effect #1” across renders.

---

## Interview one-liner 🧠

> A function component can have multiple `useEffect` hooks because each represents an independent side effect with its own lifecycle, and React tracks them by call order.

---

## When to use multiple `useEffect`s

✅ Different concerns
✅ Different dependencies
✅ Different cleanup logic

❌ Don’t combine unrelated logic just to “use fewer hooks”
