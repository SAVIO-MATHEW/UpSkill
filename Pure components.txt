A Pure Component is a special type of React class component that extends React.PureComponent instead of React.Component. It optimizes performance by automatically preventing unnecessary re-renders through a shallow comparison of props and state. This reduces the workload of the Virtual DOM’s reconciliation process, making apps more efficient.

Purpose: To skip rendering when props and state haven’t changed, minimizing Virtual DOM diffing and real DOM updates.
Key Feature: Implements shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow equality check (compares primitive values and reference equality for objects/arrays).

Pure Components are specific to class-based components. For functional components, React.memo serves a similar purpose.

Ideal Scenarios:
Components with stable props and state (e.g., primitives like strings, numbers, or immutable objects).
Performance-critical components in large apps (e.g., list items in a table, badges, or counters).
When rendering is computationally expensive or triggers costly child renders.
