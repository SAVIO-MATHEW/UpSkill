The **Context API** in React is a way to manage state across a component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Here's the flow:

---

### **1. Create Context**
- **What**: Use `createContext()` to create a context object.
- **How**: This object will be used to share data (state) between components.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { createContext } from 'react';

  const MyContext = createContext();
  ```

---

### **2. Provide Context**
- **What**: Use a `Provider` component to wrap the parts of the app where context data should be available.
- **How**: The `Provider` component has a `value` prop, which holds the data to be shared.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useState } from 'react';

  function App() {
    const [value, setValue] = useState('Hello Context!');

    return (
      <MyContext.Provider value={value}>
        <Child />
      </MyContext.Provider>
    );
  }
  ```

---

### **3. Consume Context**
- **What**: Access the context data in child components using `useContext()` or the `Consumer` component.
- **How**: `useContext()` is the most common and straightforward way to consume context.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useContext } from 'react';

  function Child() {
    const value = useContext(MyContext); // Access shared data
    return <p>{value}</p>;
  }
  ```

---

### **Flow Summary**
1. **Create a Context**: Use `createContext()` to define a context object.
2. **Provide the Context**: Wrap components with the `Provider` and supply the shared state using its `value` prop.
3. **Consume the Context**: Use `useContext()` in child components to retrieve the shared state.

### **When to Use Context**
- Avoid **prop drilling** (passing data through many nested components).
- Share **global state**, such as themes, authentication data, or user preferences.
