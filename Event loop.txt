Alright, this is one of the **MOST important JavaScript concepts** ⚡

## 🧠 What is the Event Loop?

> The **event loop** is what allows JavaScript (single-threaded) to handle **async tasks** like timers, API calls, DOM events.

JS can do **one thing at a time**, but the event loop manages *when* async callbacks run.

## 🧩 Main Parts

| Part               | Role                                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Call Stack**     | Executes functions                                         |
| **Web APIs**       | Browser handles async work (setTimeout, fetch, DOM events) |
| **Callback Queue** | Holds completed async callbacks                            |
| **Event Loop**     | Moves callbacks to stack when it's empty                   |

---

## 🔄 Flow

1. Code runs → goes to **Call Stack**
2. Async task starts → sent to **Web API**
3. When done → callback goes to **Queue**
4. Event loop checks:

   > "Is stack empty?"
   > YES → move callback to stack

---

## 🔥 Example

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);

console.log("End");
```

### Output:

```
Start
End
Timeout
```

Even `0ms` waits for stack to clear.

## ⚡ Microtasks vs Macrotasks

| Type           | Examples                            | Priority |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Microtasks** | Promises, MutationObserver          | 🔥 First |
| **Macrotasks** | setTimeout, setInterval, DOM events | After    |

---

### Example

```js
console.log("A");

setTimeout(() => console.log("B"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("C"));

console.log("D");
```

Output:

```
A
D
C   ← microtask
B   ← macrotask
```

---

## 🧠 Rule to remember

> **Synchronous → Microtasks → Macrotasks**

---

## 💡 Why this matters

Explains:

* Why promises run before timeouts
* Why UI sometimes freezes
* Why `async/await` timing works

---

### One-line definition

> Event loop = system that schedules async callbacks when the call stack is free.
