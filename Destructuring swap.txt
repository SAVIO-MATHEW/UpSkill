**Destructuring swap** is a shortcut in JavaScript to exchange values **without a temp variable**.

---

### 🔹 Normal swap (old way)

```js
let temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;
```

---

### 🔹 Destructuring swap (modern JS)

```js
[a, b] = [b, a];
```

Same result, cleaner.

---

### 🔥 How it works internally

1. Right side `[b, a]` is evaluated first
2. Values stored temporarily
3. Assigned to left side positions

So no data is lost.

---

### 🔹 Works with array elements too

```js
[arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
```

Used in:

* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Reversing arrays

---

### 🔹 Example

```js
let x = 5, y = 10;
[x, y] = [y, x];

console.log(x, y); // 10 5
```

---

### ⚠️ Important

This is **array destructuring assignment**, not a special swap operator.

---

### 🧠 One-line memory trick

> RHS builds a temporary array → LHS unpacks it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes — those two lines do the same swap ✅

Version 1
[arr[j], arr[j+1]] = [arr[j+1], arr[j]];

Version 2
[arr[j+1], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[j+1]];


Both result in:

arr[j]   ← old arr[j+1]
arr[j+1] ← old arr[j]

Why both work

Destructuring works like:

Evaluate right side first → store values temporarily

Assign them to left side in order

So order of variables on the left doesn’t matter as long as the right side is reversed accordingly.
