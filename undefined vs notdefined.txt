undefined vs not defined (ReferenceError)

undefined

Variable exists but has no value assigned

let a;
console.log(a); // undefined


Also happens when:

function test(x) {}
test(); // x === undefined


not defined

Variable does NOT exist in scope

Accessing it throws an error

console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined

🔑 Key difference (interview-ready)
Aspect	undefined	not defined
Variable declared	✅ Yes	❌ No
Value assigned	❌ No	—
Error thrown	❌ No	✅ ReferenceError

One-liner:

undefined = declared but no value
not defined = never declared
