# 🔥 For You (React 5 Years)

If they ask:

> How do you work in Scrum?

Say:

> We follow 2-week sprints. During sprint planning, tasks are estimated using story points. Daily standups track progress. I ensure my tasks are completed within sprint and raise blockers early. Code reviews and testing happen before sprint review.
