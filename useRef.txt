When you write:

const ref = useRef(null);

React returns an object like:

{
  current: null
}

So useRef always returns an object, not a direct value.

🔹 Why Not Just Return the Value?

Because React needs:

A stable reference object across renders

A place to store a mutable value

Something that does not trigger re-render when updated

The object itself stays the same.
Only .current changes.

🔹 Example
const countRef = useRef(0);

countRef.current = countRef.current + 1;

countRef → same object every render

countRef.current → mutable value

Updating it → does NOT re-render

🔥 Why This Design Matters

If useRef returned just a primitive:

let count = useRef(0);
count = 5;

React would lose track of it between renders.

By returning an object:

React preserves the reference

You can safely mutate .current
