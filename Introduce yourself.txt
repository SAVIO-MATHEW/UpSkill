"Thank you for having me. My name is Savio Mathew, and I’m a Front-End Developer with over five years of experience specializing in building scalable, user-centric React.js applications. I currently work as a Technology Analyst at Infosys Ltd, supporting Southern California Edison, where I’ve had the privilege of leading teams to deliver enterprise-grade web solutions that drive significant business impact. For instance, I spearheaded a customer portal project that increased user engagement by 25% and optimized performance to achieve a 30% improvement in page load speed, ensuring a seamless experience for thousands of users.

My technical expertise spans React.js, Redux Toolkit, Material UI, JavaScript (ES6+), and REST APIs, with a strong focus on performance optimization, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility. In one notable project, I developed a responsive employee dashboard using Material UI components, integrating it into an existing website to enable efficient service management, which improved user satisfaction by 15%. I also leveraged polyfills like core-js to ensure compatibility with legacy browsers, a critical requirement for enterprise clients. Additionally, I’ve implemented WCAG-compliant accessibility features, making applications inclusive and compliant with global standards.

As a leader in Agile and Scrum environments, I’ve managed teams of up to five developers, streamlining requirements gathering with standardized templates to boost team efficiency by 25%. My ability to translate client needs into technical solutions, as demonstrated in projects like enhancing data readability by 80% with dynamic D3.js charts, has been key to delivering client success. My contributions have been recognized with awards like the Rise Insta Award for project excellence and an H1B visa nomination for exceptional React development and leadership.
