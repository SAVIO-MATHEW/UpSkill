Nice — **TDD** is a big one in interviews and real projects.

## 🧪 What is TDD?

**TDD = Test-Driven Development**

> You **write tests first**, then write code to pass the tests.

---

## 🔁 TDD Cycle (Red → Green → Refactor)

### 🔴 1. Red

Write a test that fails.

```js
test("adds two numbers", () => {
  expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});
```

Fails because `add` doesn’t exist.

---

### 🟢 2. Green

Write the **minimum code** to pass.

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Test passes ✅

---

### 🔵 3. Refactor

Improve code without breaking tests.

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

Tests still pass → safe.

## 🧠 Why TDD?

| Benefit          | Why it matters          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Fewer bugs       | Code must satisfy tests |
| Better design    | Forces modular code     |
| Safe refactoring | Tests catch breakage    |
| Documentation    | Tests explain behavior  |

---

## ❌ Without TDD

You write code → then try testing → bugs found late.

## ✅ With TDD

You define behavior first → code only to satisfy it.

---

## 🧩 Example (real scenario)

Building login validation:

**Test first**

```js
test("password must be at least 6 chars", () => {
  expect(validatePassword("123")).toBe(false);
});
```

Then write function.

---

## ⚠️ Important

TDD does **not** mean testing UI manually.
It means **automated tests** (Jest, Mocha, etc.)

---

## 🧠 One-line understanding

> TDD = **Write failing test → make it pass → clean the code**

---

If you want, I can show **TDD for a React component** (very common interview topic).
