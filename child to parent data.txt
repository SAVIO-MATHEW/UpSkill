In React, passing data from a child component to a parent component typically involves using a callback function provided by the parent. Here's how it works:

### **Step-by-Step Approach**

1. **Define a function in the parent component**:
   - This function will handle the data received from the child.
   - Pass this function as a prop to the child component.

2. **Invoke the parent's function in the child**:
   - Call the function and pass the required data when an event occurs in the child component.

### **Example Code**

#### **Parent Component**:
```javascript
function Parent() {
  const handleDataFromChild = (data) => {
    console.log("Data received from child:", data);
  };

  return <Child sendDataToParent={handleDataFromChild} />;
}
```

#### **Child Component**:
```javascript
function Child({ sendDataToParent }) {
  const handleClick = () => {
    sendDataToParent("Hello from Child!"); // Send data to parent
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Send Data to Parent</button>;
}
```

### **What Happens**:
- The **parent** defines a function `handleDataFromChild` to process data.
- The **parent** passes this function to the child as a prop `sendDataToParent`.
- When the button in the child is clicked, the child calls `sendDataToParent` and sends data (`"Hello from Child!"`) to the parent.
- The parent logs or uses the received data.

### Key Takeaway:
By passing a function as a prop, the parent component can listen to and act on data coming from its child. This is a common pattern in React for communication between child and parent components.
