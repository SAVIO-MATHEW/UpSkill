Good 👍 this is commonly asked in frontend interviews.

# 🔥 What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML means using HTML elements that **clearly describe their meaning and purpose**.

Instead of using generic `<div>` and `<span>`, we use meaningful tags like:

* `<header>`
* `<nav>`
* `<section>`
* `<article>`
* `<footer>`
* `<main>`

# ✅ Example (Non-Semantic vs Semantic)

### ❌ Non-Semantic

```html
<div class="header"></div>
<div class="nav"></div>
<div class="content"></div>
<div class="footer"></div>
```

### ✅ Semantic

```html
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<main>
  <section></section>
</main>
<footer></footer>
```

# 🧠 Interview-Level Answer (3–4 sentences)

> Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags that describe the purpose of content instead of generic containers. It improves accessibility, SEO, and code readability. For example, using `<nav>` for navigation and `<article>` for blog posts helps screen readers and search engines understand the structure of the page.
