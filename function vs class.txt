Functional and class-based components are two ways of defining components in React. Here's how they differ:

---

### **1. Functional Components**
- **Definition**: These are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX (React's syntax for defining UI elements).
- **Syntax**: They are written as plain functions.
  
```jsx
const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};
```

- **Features**:
  - They were originally stateless but can now handle state using **hooks** like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.
  - Easier to write and understand.
  - Lightweight and readable.
  
- **Advantages**:
  - Minimal boilerplate code.
  - Hooks provide powerful functionality without needing class components.
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Before hooks, functional components were limited in features compared to class-based components.

### **2. Class-Based Components**
- **Definition**: These are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component` and include methods like `render()` to define UI.
- **Syntax**: You write them as JavaScript classes.

```jsx
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

- **Features**:
  - Can manage local state and lifecycle methods without hooks.
  - Use `this` keyword to access props, state, and methods.
  
- **Advantages**:
  - Better for handling complex features before hooks were introduced.
  - Support lifecycle methods such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, etc.
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - More verbose and harder to read for beginners.
  - `this` keyword can sometimes lead to confusion.

### **Key Differences**
| **Aspect**          | **Functional Components**                     | **Class-Based Components**               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Functions returning JSX                      | ES6 Classes extending `React.Component` |
| **State Management** | Use hooks like `useState`                    | Use `this.state`                        |
| **Lifecycle Methods**| Handled with hooks like `useEffect`          | Use built-in methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`) |
| **Complexity**       | Simplified and readable                      | More verbose                            |
| **Performance**      | Slightly better due to simpler structure     | Slightly heavier                        |

### **Current Trend**:
Functional components with hooks are now the preferred method due to their simplicity and enhanced capabilities. Class components are still valid but less commonly used in modern React development.
