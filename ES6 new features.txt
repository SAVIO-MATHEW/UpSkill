ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, introduced a host of new features that make JavaScript more powerful and developer-friendly. Here are some of the key features:

1. **Arrow Functions**: Provide a shorter syntax for writing functions and inherit the `this` context.
   ```javascript
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```

2. **Template Literals**: Allow embedded expressions and multi-line strings using backticks.
   ```javascript
   const name = 'John';
   const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
   ```

3. **Let and Const**: Introduced block-scoped variables.
   - `let`: For variables whose values will change.
   - `const`: For variables with fixed values.

4. **Default Parameters**: Enable default values in function parameters.
   ```javascript
   function multiply(a, b = 2) {
     return a * b;
   }
   ```

5. **Destructuring Assignment**: Extract values from arrays or objects into variables.
   ```javascript
   const [x, y] = [1, 2];
   const { name, age } = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
   ```

6. **Rest and Spread Operators**: For working with arrays and objects efficiently.
   - Rest:
     ```javascript
     function sum(...numbers) {
       return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
     }
     ```
   - Spread:
     ```javascript
     const arr = [1, 2, 3];
     const newArr = [...arr, 4];
     ```

7. **Classes**: Introduced a clean, syntactic sugar for object-oriented programming.
   ```javascript
   class Person {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }
     greet() {
       return `Hello, ${this.name}`;
     }
   }
   ```

8. **Promises**: Simplify handling asynchronous operations.
   ```javascript
   const fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     // Async logic here...
   });
   ```

9. **Modules**: Enable importing and exporting code between files.
   ```javascript
   // Exporting
   export const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

   // Importing
   import { sum } from './math.js';
   ```

10. **Enhanced Object Literals**: Support for shorthand properties and methods.
    ```javascript
    const name = 'Jane';
    const person = {
      name,
      greet() {
        return `Hi, I'm ${this.name}`;
      }
    };
    ```

11. **For-of Loop**: Provides a more readable way to iterate over iterable objects.
    ```javascript
    for (let num of [1, 2, 3]) {
      console.log(num);
    }
    ```

These features make JavaScript more modern, expressive, and easier to work with! Are you using any of these in your projects?
