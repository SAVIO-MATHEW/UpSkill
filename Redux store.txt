Almost — reducers are NOT state values, they produce state values.

configureStore({
  reducer: {
    count: counterReducer
  },
})

What this means

count → state key

counterReducer → function that manages that state

Summary (1-liner)

reducer object keys = state keys

reducer object values = reducer functions

Reducers generate state, they are not the state themselves
------------------------------------------------------------------
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    sliceB: sliceBReducer,  // sliceB runs first now
    sliceA: sliceAReducer,
  }
});
Dispatching actionX now runs:

sliceB.addCase → sliceB.addMatcher

sliceA.addCase → sliceA.addMatcher

Inside each slice, addCase still runs before addMatcher.
Slices run in the order they are combined in the store; within a slice, addCase handlers run first, followed by addMatcher handlers.
