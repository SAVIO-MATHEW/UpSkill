**Synthetic Events** are React’s **cross-browser event system** — and they’re *key* to understanding batching, performance, and consistency.

---

## What is a Synthetic Event?

> A **Synthetic Event** is a wrapper around the browser’s native event that React creates to normalize behavior across browsers.

Instead of attaching listeners to every DOM node, React:

* listens at the **root**
* intercepts native events
* dispatches **Synthetic Events** to your components

---

## Why React invented Synthetic Events

### 1️⃣ Cross-browser consistency

Different browsers used to behave differently:

* `event.target`
* `event.key`
* `event.preventDefault()`

Synthetic Events normalize this.

---

### 2️⃣ Event delegation (performance)

React attaches **one listener per event type** at the root.

```txt
Document
  └─ React listener
       └─ dispatch to components
```

Instead of:

* 1000 DOM listeners ❌
* 1 React listener ✅

---

### 3️⃣ Enables batching

Because React **controls the event lifecycle**, it knows:

* when an event starts
* when it ends

That’s why:

```js
onClick={() => {
  setA(1);
  setB(2);
}}
```

👉 causes **one render**, not two.

---

## Example

```jsx
function App() {
  const handleClick = (e) => {
    console.log(e); // SyntheticEvent
    console.log(e.nativeEvent); // real DOM event
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>;
}
```

---

## Event pooling (important but historical)

Older React versions reused event objects:

```js
console.log(e.target); // ❌ null later
```

Fixed by:

```js
e.persist();
```

⚠️ **Event pooling was removed in React 17**.

## Synthetic vs Native events

| Feature              | Synthetic | Native |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| Cross-browser        | ✅         | ❌      |
| Batching support     | ✅         | ❌      |
| Delegated            | ✅         | ❌      |
| `nativeEvent` access | ✅         | —      |

---

## Why React still keeps them (even now)

Even with modern browsers:

* batching
* delegation
* predictable lifecycle
* concurrent rendering safety

---

## Interview one-liner 🧠

> Synthetic Events are React’s normalized event system that wraps native browser events, enables event delegation, and allows React to batch state updates efficiently.
