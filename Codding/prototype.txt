A prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties. Every JavaScript object has an internal link to its prototype, forming a chain called the prototype chain. Property lookups traverse this chain until the property is found or the chain ends at Object.prototype.

2. What is the difference between __proto__ and prototype?
Answer:

prototype: A property of constructor functions. It defines the object that will become the prototype of instances created with new.

__proto__: An internal property of objects that points to their prototype. Example:

js
function Person() {}
const p = new Person();
console.log(p.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true
3. How does the prototype chain work?
Answer: When accessing a property:

JavaScript checks the object itself.

If not found, it checks the object’s prototype (__proto__).

This continues up the chain until Object.prototype.

If still not found, the result is undefined.

4. How are ES6 classes related to prototypes?
Answer: ES6 classes are syntactic sugar over prototype-based inheritance. Methods defined in a class are placed on the constructor’s prototype. For example:

js
class Animal {
  speak() { console.log("sound"); }
}
const dog = new Animal();
console.log(typeof dog.speak); // function
Here, speak lives on Animal.prototype.

5. Why are prototypes important?
Answer:

They enable inheritance without duplicating methods across instances.

They make memory usage efficient since methods are shared.

They form the foundation of JavaScript’s object-oriented programming model.
