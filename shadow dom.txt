The Shadow DOM is a web standard that allows encapsulation of a DOM subtree and styles, isolated from the main document DOM. It’s commonly used in web components to create reusable, self-contained UI elements with scoped styles and markup, preventing conflicts with global styles or scripts.
Accessed via element.shadowRoot.
Encapsulation: Styles and DOM are scoped to the component, unaffected by external CSS/JavaScript.
Isolation: Prevents style leaks (e.g., global SCSS/CSS won’t affect Shadow DOM elements).
Reusability: Used in custom elements (e.g., <input> or custom web components).
