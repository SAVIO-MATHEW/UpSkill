**Quick Answer:**  
The CSS `position` property defines how an element is placed in a document. It controls whether the element follows the normal page flow or is positioned relative to its parent, the viewport, or scroll behavior. The main values are **static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky**.

## 🧩 CSS `position` Property Explained

### 1. **Static (default)**
- Elements are positioned according to the normal document flow.
- `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` have no effect.
- Example:
  ```css
  p {
    position: static;
  }
  ```

### 2. **Relative**
- Positioned relative to its normal position.
- You can use `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` to "nudge" it.
- Example:
  ```css
  div {
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 10px;
  }
  ```

### 3. **Absolute**
- Positioned relative to the nearest ancestor with `position` other than `static`.
- Removed from normal flow, so other elements act as if it doesn’t exist.
- Example:
  ```css
  h2 {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px;
    left: 100px;
  }
  ```

### 4. **Fixed**
- Positioned relative to the **viewport** (browser window).
- Stays in place even when the page is scrolled.
- Example:
  ```css
  nav {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
  }
  ```

### 5. **Sticky**
- Acts like `relative` until a scroll threshold is reached, then it "sticks" like `fixed`.
- Useful for headers or menus that stay visible while scrolling.
- Example:
  ```css
  header {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
  }
  ```

## ⚖️ Comparison Table

| Value     | Positioned Relative To                | Stays in Flow? | Scroll Behavior |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Static    | Normal document flow                   | ✅ Yes         | Moves with page |
| Relative  | Its normal position                    | ✅ Yes         | Moves with page |
| Absolute  | Nearest positioned ancestor            | ❌ No          | Moves with ancestor |
| Fixed     | Browser viewport                       | ❌ No          | Stays fixed     |
| Sticky    | Normal position until scroll threshold | ✅ Yes         | Sticks after threshold |

## 🚨 Key Considerations
- **Absolute vs Fixed:** Absolute depends on parent, Fixed depends on viewport.
- **Sticky support:** Works in modern browsers, but older versions (like Edge 15) don’t fully support it.
- **Z-index:** Often used with positioned elements to control stacking order.

**In short:** Use `position: relative` for small adjustments, `absolute` for precise placement inside containers, `fixed` for elements that should stay visible, and `sticky` for scroll-based effects.
